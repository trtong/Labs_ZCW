## Clauses

Select Clause  
From Clause

#### Insert people into People table

```SQL
INSERT INTO PEOPLE (LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, MOBILE, BIRTHDAY)
VALUES ('Smith', 'John', '230-4293', '1973-01-23');
```

Following the example, insert at least three other people into the table.

#### Selecting all rows from table

```

Update multiple columns with multiple conditions

```SQL
UPDATE people SET birthday = '1955-01-25' 
WHERE 
	lastName = 'Smith' 
	AND id = 4;
```

```SQL
UPDATE people SET mobile = '333-3333', lastName = 'Johnson' 
WHERE firstName = 'Noelle' OR firstName = 'Raj';

```

```SQL
SELECT LENGTH(address), CHAR_LENGTH(address) FROM HOME;
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE length_test (string varchar(10) );
```

```SQL
INSERT INTO length_test VALUES ('$'),('â‚¬');
```

```SQL
SELECT string, LENGTH(string), CHAR_LENGTH(string) FROM length_test
```

## Compare

```SQL
SELECT firstName, lastName, YEAR(birthday) FROM people WHERE birthday >= '1970-07-06' AND birthday<='1987-07-06';
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, birthday FROM people WHERE firstName='Thomas' OR firstName='Raj' OR firstName='Sheeri';
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, birthday FROM people WHERE firstName IN ('Noelle', 'Thomas', 'Raj');
```

#### Wild Cards

```SQL
SELECT firstName FROM PEOPLE WHERE RIGHT(firstName,1)='e';
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName FROM people WHERE firstName LIKE '%j'; 
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName FROM people WHERE firstName LIKE '%o%';
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName FROM people WHERE firstName NOT LIKE '%o%';
```

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PEOPLE
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, COUNT(*) FROM people GROUP BY lastName;
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, GROUP_CONCAT(mobile) FROM PEOPLE GROUP BY lastName;
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, GROUP_CONCAT(mobile SEPARATOR ' and ') FROM people GROUP BY lastName;
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, GROUP_CONCAT(mobile SEPARATOR ' and ') FROM people GROUP BY lastName  HAVING COUNT(*)>1;
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, GROUP_CONCAT(mobile SEPARATOR ' and ') FROM people WHERE lastName != 'Cabral' GROUP BY lastName  HAVING COUNT(*)>1;
```

#### Sorting 

```SQL
SELECT firstName, birthday FROM people ORDER BY birthday;
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, birthday FROM people ORDER BY birthday DESC;
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, lastName FROM people ORDER BY lastName, firstName;
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, birthday FROM people ORDER BY birthday DESC LIMIT 3;
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, MONTHNAME(birthday) as mon, birthday FROM people ORDER BY MONTH(birthday);
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, COUNT(*) FROM  people GROUP BY lastName;
```

```SQL
SELECT lastName, COUNT(*) FROM  people GROUP BY lastName ORDER BY NULL;
```

## Inserting and Replacing Records

```SQL
INSERT INTO people (firstName, lastName, birthday, home_id)
	VALUES
	('John', 'Smith', '1998-04-07', 4),
	('Maya', 'Wasserman' , NULL, 4),
	('Paul', 'Thompson', '1996-05-27', 1);
```

#### Replace

```SQL
DELETE FROM people WHERE firstName='Maya';
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM people;
```

```SQL
MERGE INTO people (firstName, lastName, birthday, home_id)
	VALUES
	('John', 'Sharma', '1998-04-07', 1),
	('Paul', 'Sharma', '1996-05-27', 4),
	('Maya', 'Wasserman', '1900-01-05',1);
```


## JOIN

```SQL
INSERT INTO people (firstName, lastName, birthday)
	VALUES ('Eli', 'Kramer', '1984-01-15');
```
	
	
```SQL
SELECT * FROM people;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM home;
```

```SQL
SELECT p.firstName, h.address 
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.ID)
```

```SQL
SELECT firstName, lastName
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.HOME_ID)
WHERE p.HOME_ID = 1
```

```SQL
SELECT p.*, h.address, h.homenumber
FROM PEOPLE p
INNER JOIN HOME h  on (p.HOME_ID = h.HOME_ID)
WHERE p.firstName  LIKE '%e%'
```

##### Exercise:

Devise a report
	show all the people in your address table
	only if you know their birthday
	show name, address and birthday
	order by month, so January birthdays are first

Devise a report
	Output all information for all people and their home information


	
## UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.

SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table1
	UNION
SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table2;

Note: The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use the ALL keyword with UNION.

SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table1
	UNION ALL
SELECT _column\_name(s)_ FROM table2;

##### Example

```SQL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM People
UNION
SELECT HOME_ID FROM Home
ORDER 	BY HOME_ID; 
```

```SQL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM People
UNION ALL
SELECT HOME_ID FROM Home
ORDER 	BY HOME_ID; 
```

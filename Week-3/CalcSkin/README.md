# CalcSkin: Add a Calculator UI!

Add a calculator "skin" UI to your calc project.

_ScientificCalculator_ can move to Release 2.0!!

Using the classes you had for the scientific calculator, 
add this JavaFX UI to the front of it.

Run this project to see what you're going to be working with.

The best way to integrate this skin class might just be adding the __CalcSkin__ 
class to your project, and moving Console 
out of the way and wiring it up.
CalcEngine is a "fails all tests" class, and you should use the one from your project anyway.
See the MainApplication class to see how to call it from your __main__ method.

Making a simple 4-function calculator should be trivial for you at this stage.

*BUT*, how about adding a column of buttons for x-squared, square-root, inverse (1/x), and
exponent (x^y).

Then you might add a column of buttons that do the Memory functions.
(What should you add to the UI to make this easier??)

Finally, work on adding the trig and log functions from the original lab.

Feel free to work in your original groups, get everyone up to speed on this!

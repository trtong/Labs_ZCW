## Section 1 - MathUtilities
Make all the tests in the `MathUtilitiesTest` class pass. All the methods have been stubbed out for you in the `MathUtilities` class. Each of the method has a comment above it to describe the expected behavior. Look at the test case to see example of input and expected output.
  - `int add(int num1, int num2)`
  - `double add(double num1, double num2)`
  - `double half(int number)`
  - `boolean isOdd(int number)`
  - `int square(int number)`

## Section 2 - StringUtilities
Make all the tests in the `StringUtilitiesTest` class pass. All the methods have been stubbed out for you in the `StringUtilities` class. Each of the method has a comment above it to describe the expected behavior. Look at the test case to see example of input and expected output.

  - `Character getMiddleCharacter(String word)`
  - `String removeCharacter(String value, char charToRemove)`
  - `String getLastWord(String value)`

## Section 3 - LoopFun
Make all the tests in the `LoopFunTest` class pass. All the methods have been stubbed
out for you in the `LoopFun` class.
Each of the method has a comment above it to describe the expected behavior.
Look at the test case to see example of input and expected output.

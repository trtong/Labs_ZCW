Reading from a website code

The program is using the scanner class as a reader.
Up to this point, we've used it to take in inputs
from the keyboard, but redirecting the input to the
URL "mySite" and establishing a connection between
the site and our scanner, it can read what's on the site.

The while loop checks that there is something
to return back by checking if "hasNext" == true.

From there, the program keeps track of how many lines with the count variable and then returns it
at the end.

The try/catch is for handling exception errors?
It will try the program and then if there is an exception it will catch it and then show Documentation what might have happened.

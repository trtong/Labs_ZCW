# First Saturday

First weekend lab. Overall idea is to read the code, read the tests, and then write some code to pass all the tests.

**Be sure to Fork this repo into your account and `git clone` your own forked copy of this code in a terminal.**

Be sure to commit all your changes multiple times as you're working on the lab.

`git commit -m "checkpointing my work"` should do, be sure to change the message to something meaningful to the work you're saving.

When you are finished, and are passing all the tests, be sure to do a final `git commit` and then do a `Pull Request` so we can review your work.




now see [README.TXT](README.TXT).

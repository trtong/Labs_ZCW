Lab Brief
---------

The objective of this lab is to give you an opportunity to think through IF statements
and LOOPS (WHILE, DO WHILE, and FOR).

You will need to read the TEST classes first, to get a feel for what you have to write
for the CODE classes.

Work through code class WriteIFs.java, follow the directions for each method. 
Run All Tests on the class until you pass them all.

Work through code class WriteLoops.java, follow the directions for each method. 
Run All Tests on the class until you pass them all. For each of the loop methods,
you need to put the code about w = w + 1; inside of the loops. It lets the test know how
many iterations of the loop your code did. This data is used to make sure you passed the tests.

You may not change ANY existing test methods. You get extra credit(!) for each test you add.

Be sure to pass all the tests with your code.
